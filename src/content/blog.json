Teams can choose the track that best fits their interests or mix ideas across tracks.</p><h3>🌍 Social Impact and Sustainability</h3><p>Build solutions that address challenges in health, education, climate, agriculture, or access to services. Projects in this track should focus on real people and real outcomes.</p><h3>💼 Fintech and Digital Economy</h3><p>Explore payments, financial inclusion, small business tools, or new ways to support the growing digital economy across Africa.</p><h3>🤖 AI and Emerging Tech</h3><p>Use machine learning, data, or automation to solve problems creatively and responsibly. Strong projects clearly explain how AI improves the solution, not just that it uses it.</p><h3>🎓 Student Innovation</h3><p>A space for newer hackers and students to experiment, learn, and build confidently. This track emphasizes learning, creativity, and execution over complexity.</p><h2>Prizes That Actually Matter</h2><p>Winning is exciting, but we believe prizes should help teams keep going after the hackathon ends.</p><p>For JengaHacks 2026, prizes may include:</p><ul><li>Cash awards</li><li>Cloud credits and developer tools</li><li>Mentorship and startup support</li><li>Opportunities to showcase your project publicly</li></ul><p>More details will be announced closer to the event.</p><h2>Mentors, Workshops, and Support</h2><p>You will not be building alone.</p><p>Throughout the weekend, participants will have access to:</p><ul><li>Technical mentors</li><li>Design and product guidance</li><li>Short workshops on pitching, teamwork, and rapid prototyping</li><li>Office hours to unblock stuck teams</li></ul><p>Mentors are there to help, not judge.
