This track emphasizes learning, creativity, and execution over complexity.</p><h2>Prizes That Actually Matter</h2><p>Winning is exciting, but we believe prizes should help teams keep going after the hackathon ends.</p><p>For JengaHacks 2026, prizes may include:</p><ul><li>Cash awards</li><li>Cloud credits and developer tools</li><li>Mentorship and startup support</li><li>Opportunities to showcase your project publicly</li></ul><p>More details will be announced closer to the event.</p><h2>Mentors, Workshops, and Support</h2><p>You will not be building alone.</p><p>Throughout the weekend, participants will have access to:</p><ul><li>Technical mentors</li><li>Design and product guidance</li><li>Short workshops on pitching, teamwork, and rapid prototyping</li><li>Office hours to unblock stuck teams</li></ul><p>Mentors are there to help, not judge.

    "excerpt": "Expert advice on time management, team formation, and building a winning project at JengaHacks.",
    "content": "<p>Hackathons are intense, exciting, and incredibly rewarding experiences. With only 36 hours to build something from scratch, every minute counts. Whether you're a first-time hacker or a seasoned participant, these tips will help you make the most of your time at JengaHacks 2026.</p><h2>Before the Hackathon</h2><h3>1. Come Prepared</h3><p>While you can't code before the event starts, you can prepare:</p><ul><li><strong>Learn the basics:</strong> Brush up on common frameworks and tools you might use</li><li><strong>Set up your environment:</strong> Install necessary software, create accounts for APIs you might need</li><li><strong>Bring essentials:</strong> Laptop, charger, headphones, water bottle, and snacks</li><li><strong>Get rest:</strong> Sleep well the night before - you'll need your energy</li></ul><h3>2. Form or Join a Team</h3><p>While you can work solo, teams often produce better results:</p><ul><li>Find teammates with complementary skills (designer + developer + business person)</li><li>Discuss ideas beforehand, but be open to pivoting</li><li>If you're solo, attend team formation sessions at the event</li></ul><h2>During the Hackathon</h2><h3>1. Time Management is Everything</h3><p>Break down your 36 hours strategically:</p><ul><li><strong>Hours 0-2:</strong> Ideation and planning. Don't start coding immediately</li><li><strong>Hours 2-4:</strong> Set up your project structure, choose your tech stack</li><li><strong>Hours 4-30:</strong> Build, build, build (with breaks!)</li><li><strong>Hours 30-34:</strong> Polish, fix bugs, prepare demo</li><li><strong>Hours 34-36:</strong> Final touches and presentation prep</li></ul><h3>2. Start Simple, Then Iterate</h3><p>The best hackathon projects:</p><ul><li>Solve a real problem clearly</li><li>Have a working demo (even if basic)</li><li>Show potential for growth</li></ul><p>Don't try to build everything. Focus on one core feature that works well.</p><h3>3. Take Care of Yourself</h3><p>You can't code effectively if you're exhausted:</p><ul><li>Take regular breaks (every 1-2 hours)</li><li>Eat meals - don't skip them</li><li>Stay hydrated</li><li>Get some sleep if possible (even 2-3 hours helps)</li><li>Step outside for fresh air</li></ul><h3>4. Use Available Resources</h3><p>Don't struggle alone:</p><ul><li>Ask mentors for help when stuck</li><li>Attend workshops - they're designed to help you</li><li>Use office hours to unblock technical issues</li><li>Collaborate with other teams if appropriate</li></ul><h3>5. Focus on the Demo</h3><p>Remember: judges see your demo, not your code:</p><ul><li>Make sure your demo works smoothly</li><li>Prepare a clear, concise pitch (2-3 minutes)</li><li>Show the problem you're solving</li><li>Demonstrate your solution</li><li>Explain the impact and next steps</li></ul><h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2><ul><li><strong>Over-engineering:</strong> Don't build features you don't need</li><li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> Done is better than perfect</li><li><strong>Working alone:</strong> Even if you're solo, ask for help</li><li><strong>Skipping breaks:</strong> Burnout kills productivity</li><li><strong>Ignoring the problem:</strong> Technology is a means, not the end</li></ul><h2>Final Tips</h2><ul><li><strong>Have fun:</strong> Hackathons are about learning and meeting people</li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Talk to other participants, mentors, and sponsors</li><li><strong>Document:</strong> Take notes, screenshots, and record your demo</li><li><strong>Be proud:</strong> Whatever you build in 36 hours is an achievement</li></ul><p>Remember: The goal isn't just to win prizes. It's to learn, build something meaningful, and have a great time doing it. Good luck, and we can't wait to see what you create!</p>",
